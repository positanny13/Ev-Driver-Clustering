# Ev-Driver-Clustering
This project aims to cluster electric vehicle drivers based on their driving behavior data provided by Lithion Power, a company that rents out batteries to e-vehicle drivers. The goal is to group drivers together based on their driving history and use these clusters to incentivize drivers.
